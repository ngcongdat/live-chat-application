# Gmail SMTP Application!

Hi! I'm Dat. This is a very simple Client/Server Chat Application using `TCP Sockets Java`. 


## How to Works
 - **Step 1:** Run the server before the client, because the server keeps waiting for the client to be connected.
 - **Step 2:** Run the client.
 - **Step 3:** Input host IP, port and username. Then click Connect.
 - **Step 4:** In Server Box frame, you can see all users connect with server. You double click on user you want to connect.
 - **Step 5:** When show chat dialog, begin chat between server and that user.
